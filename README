README for Text-FixedWidth-Helper

Preparation and verification of fixed-width data are often part of software
development projects.  Because fixed-width data is more difficult for humans
to visually decode than character-delimited data, it is often difficult to
construct and/or verify small sample files.  This library provides assistance
with that task.

This library assumes that the user of a program can type a plain-text file in
a simple format and present it, perhaps via a GUI interface, to a Perl program
using the library.

You should be able to use this set of instructions to install the module.

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
